# Performance-Comparison-using-OpenSSL
The goal of this lab is to compare the performance of public-key encryption (RSA) and symmetric-key encryption (AES) using OpenSSL. We generate a small message, encrypt and decrypt it using RSA and AES, measure the time taken, and compare the results with OpenSSL’s built-in benchmarking tool.
